This project was commissioned by the New Hampshire association of DECA, a
Career Technical Student Organization and nonprofit. I built them an updated
site that includes features like a headless CMS, searchable news feed, and a
custom photo album that pulls images from twitter using a REST API.

  src="/images/deca2.png"
  border="5px solid"
  borderColor={React.useContext(ThemeContext)}
  borderRadius="2px"
  ml="20px"
  w="85%"
  my="20px"
/>

The Headless CMS is the only login-gated area of the site. From here posts
    can be added to the news feed, and pages can be edited. The site is also
    100% dynamic, so pages can be added and removed from the CMS as well. The
    only pages that cannot be removed are dynamic features such as the calendar,
    news feed, or photo album.

  border="5px solid"
  borderColor={React.useContext(ThemeContext)}
  borderRadius="2px"
  ml="20px"
  w="85%"
  my="20px"
/>

The photo album uses the twitter API and a Google Cloud Function to pull any
    images off of twitter using the hashtag #NHDECA and store the media link in
    firebase. The result is an albun of related photos from the start date of
    the website through the current date that have been posted on twitter.
    Images are paginated through firebase.
