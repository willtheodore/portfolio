I built this calculator widget as part of my internship at MealMe during Summer 2022. The project was done in a single HTML file using CSS and JS in `style` and `script` tags.
The widget estimates how much revenue a potential API customer would earn using MealMe, and it led to an increase in inbound sales when included on the website.

I cannot include any code produced during my internship due to my employment contract.
