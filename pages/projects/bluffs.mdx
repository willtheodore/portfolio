This project was commissioned by a local swim and tennis club. Their old
website was outdated and in need of an update. I built a new one that
includes interactive web application features such as posting and
commenting, multiple user authentication levels, and an interactive
Calendar.

  my="20px"
/>

The project was built using React JS and Google Cloud Platform. An account
    is required to access the “members” tab which contains the interactive
    features used in the operations of the club. Each feature on the site was custom built to meet the specific day-to-day needs of the Bluffs.

/>

The Admin Center is only accessible to users designated as an admin. It
    contains pages to create and edit posts, manage calendar events, authorize
    other admins, and upload files to create job postings or update the
    membership application file.
