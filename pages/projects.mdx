<ProjectShowcase title="Bedford Bluffs" nodes={3} url="www.bedfordbluffs.com">
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/bluffs1.png">
    This project was commissioned by a local swim and tennis club. Their old
    website was outdated and in need of an update. I built a new one that
    included interactive web application features such as posting and
    commenting, multiple user authentication levels, and an interactive
    calendar.
  </ProjectSlide>
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/bluffs2.png">
    The project was built using React JS and Google Cloud Platform. An account
    is required to access the “members” tab which contains the interactive
    features used in the operations of the club.

    The Admin Center is only accessible to users designated as an admin. It
    contains pages to create and edit posts, manage calendar events, authorize
    other admins, and upload files to create job postings or update the
    membership application file.

### Technologies/Products used: ReactJS, GCP, Typescript, Figma, Git. Code is available for reference on Github.

    At the moment, the only two projects I have completed are this portfolio
    website and the bluffs site above. I designed this website in Adobe XD and
    wrote the code using ReactJS, Chakra UI, and Typescript. Animations are done
    using CSS. If you are interested in having me build something for your
    business, send me an email!
