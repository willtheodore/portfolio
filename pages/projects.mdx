    This project was commissioned by a local swim and tennis club. Their old
    website was outdated and in need of an update. I built a new one that
    included interactive web application features such as posting and
    commenting, multiple user authentication levels, and an interactive
    calendar.
  </ProjectSlide>
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/bluffs2.png">
    The project was built using React JS and Google Cloud Platform. An account
    is required to access the “members” tab which contains the interactive
    features used in the operations of the club.

    The Admin Center is only accessible to users designated as an admin. It
    contains pages to create and edit posts, manage calendar events, authorize
    other admins, and upload files to create job postings or update the
    membership application file.

<ProjectShowcase title="NH DECA" nodes={4} url="www.nhdeca.org">
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/deca1.png">
    This project was commissioned by the New Hampshire chapter of DECA, a Career
    Technical Student Organization and nonprofit. I built them an updated site
    that includes features like a headless CMS, searchable news feed, and a
    custom photo album that pulls images from twitter using a REST API.
  </ProjectSlide>
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/deca2.png">
    I used Google Firebase for an easy and inexpsneive database for this
    project. The main other technology used is NEXT JS. This was ideal for this
    client to optimize Search Engine Optimization (SEO) through static site
    generation for the news feed. Every time a page is edited or a post is
    created the site is automatically rebuilt through a hook on Vercel.
  </ProjectSlide>
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/deca3.png">
    The Headless CMS is the only login-gated area of the site. From here posts
    can be added to the news feed, and pages can be edited. The site is also
    100% dynamic, so pages can be added and removed from the CMS as well. The
    only pages that cannot be removed are dynamic features such as the calendar,
    news feed, or photo album.
  </ProjectSlide>
  <ProjectSlide photoURL="/images/deca4.png">
    The photo album uses the twitter API and a Google Cloud Function to pull any
    images off of twitter using the hashtag #NHDECA and store the media link in
    firebase. The result is an albun of related photos from the start date of
    the website through the current date that have been posted on twitter.
    Images are paginated through firebase.

    I designed this website in Adobe XD and wrote the code using ReactJS, Chakra
    UI, and Typescript. Animations are done using CSS. If you are interested in
